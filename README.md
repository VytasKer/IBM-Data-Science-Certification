# IBM Data Science Professional Certificate

This repository contains projects and assignments completed as part of the **IBM Data Science Professional Certificate**, which I earned in [Month, Year]. This comprehensive program provided me with a strong foundation in data science, machine learning, and data visualization using popular tools and libraries.

## Courses Completed:
### 1. **What is Data Science?**
   - An overview of the field of data science, its various roles, and how data-driven decisions are made. We explored real-world applications of data science across industries and the skills required to become a successful data scientist.

### 2. **Tools for Data Science**
   - Introduction to popular data science tools like Jupyter Notebooks, R Studio, and Git. We learned how to use them effectively in a professional environment to develop and share data science projects.

### 3. **Data Science Methodology**
   - A structured approach to solving data science problems through the CRISP-DM framework. The course emphasized understanding the business problem, preparing data, modeling, and deploying solutions.

### 4. **Python for Data Science, AI & Development**
   - This course covered Python fundamentals and introduced libraries like **NumPy**, **Pandas**, and **Matplotlib** for data manipulation and visualization. We also explored **APIs**, working with different data formats (CSV, JSON), and web scraping.

### 5. **Python Project for Data Science**
   - Practical application of Python in solving data problems. We worked with **Jupyter Notebooks** to clean, analyze, and visualize data, applying knowledge from previous courses to real-world data sets.

### 6. **Databases and SQL for Data Science**
   - A deep dive into SQL and how to use it to query and manage data in relational databases. The course also introduced concepts like database design, normalization, and how to interact with databases using Python.

### 7. **Data Analysis with Python**
   - Focusing on data analysis techniques using **Pandas** and **NumPy** for manipulating and analyzing large data sets. We applied various statistical methods and techniques to derive insights from data.

### 8. **Data Visualization with Python**
   - Visualization techniques using **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**, and **Folium** to effectively communicate insights. This course emphasized the importance of visual storytelling and how to create meaningful and aesthetically appealing plots.

### 9. **Machine Learning with Python**
   - Introduction to machine learning concepts and algorithms, including **supervised**, **unsupervised**, and **semi-supervised** learning. We implemented models using **scikit-learn** and focused on regression, classification, clustering, and recommendation systems.

### 10. **Applied Data Science Capstone**
   - The final capstone project, where we applied the knowledge gained from the previous courses to a real-world data science problem.

## Capstone Project: **Analyzing SpaceX Falcon9 Launch Data**

### Overview:
In the capstone project, I analyzed data from SpaceX's Falcon9 rocket launches to predict whether a first-stage booster would successfully land after a mission. The dataset provided by SpaceX contained historical launch records, including payload information, launch outcomes, and booster types.

### Objectives:
- Understand and preprocess Falcon9 launch data, performing data cleaning and transformation.
- Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify important features influencing booster landing outcomes.
- Use machine learning models (classification algorithms) to predict the success of booster landings based on various features like payload mass, launch site, orbit type, and booster version.

### Key Steps:
1. **Data Collection**: I scraped Falcon9 launch data from public sources, such as SpaceX's API and NASA's website.
2. **Data Cleaning & EDA**: The data was cleaned and explored using **Pandas** and **Seaborn**, where I identified trends and patterns in the data.
3. **Feature Engineering**: I created additional features to enhance the prediction model's accuracy.
4. **Modeling**: I implemented and evaluated several classification models including **Logistic Regression**, **Random Forest**, and **Support Vector Machines**.
5. **Model Evaluation**: The models were evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, with a focus on boosting landing success rates.

### Results:
- Successfully developed a machine learning model that could predict the success of Falcon9 first-stage booster landings with high accuracy.
- Gained valuable insights into how different factors like payload mass and launch site impact the success of booster recovery.

### Technologies Used:
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- **SQL** for querying the dataset
- **Jupyter Notebooks** for development and presentation
